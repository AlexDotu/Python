# Task 1: Analyzing Weather Data. You have a JSON file weather_data.json that contains information
about the weather in different cities for a week. The data includes date, city name, temperature, humidity, and weather condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.). You need to identify the city with the highest average temperature for the week and print its name along with the average temperature.

import json

with open('./JSON/weather.json', 'r') as forecast_file:
    data_from_json = json.load(forecast_file)

city_temp_sums = {}
city_temp_counts = {}

for key in data_from_json["weather"]:
    town = key["city"]
    temperature = key["temperature"]

    if town not in city_temp_sums:
        city_temp_sums[town] = 0
        city_temp_counts[town] = 0

    city_temp_sums[town] += temperature
    city_temp_counts[town] += 1
for first_city in city_temp_sums:
    break

max_avg_temp = city_temp_sums[first_city] / city_temp_counts[first_city]
hottest_city = first_city

for city in city_temp_sums:
    avg_temp = city_temp_sums[city] / city_temp_counts[city]

    if avg_temp > max_avg_temp:
        max_avg_temp = avg_temp
        hottest_city = city

print(
    f"The city with the highest average temperature is {hottest_city} with an average temperature of {max_avg_temp}Â°C.")
